<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 lb top sirloin steak, thinly sliced into strips</li>
    <li>2 tbsp of olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tbsp of unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1/2 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1/2 lb of brown mushrooms, thickly sliced</li>
    <li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
    <li>1 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 cup of beef broth</li>
    <li>3/4 cup of heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of sour cream</li>
    <li>1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce></li>
    <li>1/2 tsp of dijon mustard</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Place a large deep pan or dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add 2 Tbsp oil and once oil is very hot, add thinly
        sliced beef strips in a single layer, cooking 1 minute per side without stirring. Cook until just browned and no
        longer red. Sear beef in 2 batches so you don't overcrowd the pan. Remove beef to a plate and cover to keep
        warm.</li>
    <li>Add 2 Tbsp butter, chopped onion and sliced mushrooms. Sautee 6-8 minutes or until liquid has evaporated and
        onions and mushrooms are soft and lightly browned.</li>
    <li>Add 1 minced garlic clove and sautee 1 minute until fragrant. Add 1 Tbsp flour and sautee another minute
        stirring constantly.</li>
    <li>Pour in 1 cups beef broth, scraping any bits from the bottom of the pan then add 3/4 cup whipping cream and
        simmer another 1 to 2 minutes or until slightly thickened. </li>
    <li>Stir a few Tablespoons of the sauce into 1/4 cup of sour cream to temper it so the sour cream doesnâ€™t curdle
        then add it to the pan while stirring constantly.</li>
    <li>Stir in 1 Tbsp Worcestershire, 1/2 tsp dijon mustard, and season with 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper, or season
        to taste and continue simmering until sauce is creamy. Add beef with any accumulated juices back to the pan and
        bring just to a simmer or until beef is heated through.</li>
</ol>
